\section*{Abstract}
This report explores the application of the Pix2Pix network for predicting LiDAR intensity mpas using RGB images and depth information as additional input. The used dense depth maps are created from the rgb images process thurg Bilateral Propagation Network for Depth Completion and the DepthAnything models (v1 and v2). This appproach used rgb pictures from the kitti dataset and explores potential improvements in prediction accuracy and robustness over conventional methods.
