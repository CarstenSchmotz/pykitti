\section*{Abstract}
This report explores the application of the Pix2Pix network for predicting LiDAR intensity maps using RGB images and depth information as additional input. The dense depth maps used are generated from the RGB images using the Bilateral Propagation Network for Depth Completion and the DepthAnything models (v1 and v2). This approach uses RGB images from the KITTI dataset and explores potential improvements in prediction accuracy and robustness over conventional methods.
