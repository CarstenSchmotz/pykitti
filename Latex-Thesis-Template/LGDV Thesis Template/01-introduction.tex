\section{Motivation}
\label{sect:motivation}
LiDAR senors provide critical depth information for autonomous driving and robotics. The LiDAR intensity maps are often spares and incomplete. Using depht maps as an addtional input is a way to impove the richness and accuracy ot the LiDAR predection. The Pix2Pix network for image-to-image translation offers a promising approch for integrating these modalities. 
\section{Contribution}
This project explores the use of the Pix2Pix network to predict LiDAR intensity maps by leveraging RGB images and depth maps as additional inputs.
\section{Related Work}
DeptAnything Models: \newline DepthAnything represents a significant advancement in monocular depth estimation by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data at a large scale. Trained on 1.5 million labeled images and over 62 million unlabeled images, DepthAnything achieves state-of-the-art performance in depth estimation tasks. The model excels in both zero-shot relative and metric depth estimation, outperforming previous models such as MiDaS v3.1 and ZoeDepth.

\chapter{Predicting LIDAR Intensity from RGB and Depth Images}
\section{Setup}
The used the bp net it is for depth completion and depth prediction
pix2pix model with modified data loader to get 4 dim. input rgb plus depth
used base model for depthanything
\section{Implementation}
\section{Results}
test run rgb only. depht from depthanything the depth from depthanything v2 and metriv form depthanything v2 6 runs with different solution
